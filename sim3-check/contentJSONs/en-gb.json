Note that this version is 'interim' and will see fundamental additions later in 2022 and 2023, especially for other types of security teams than CSIRTs, which were the focus of the original SIM3. Also note that for CSIRTs, the original SIM3 and SIM3 v2 interim are compatible, with the exception of the O-6 Parameter which was lacking in the original SIM3 and now has been added to SIM3 v2 interim. All other differences between both for CSIRTs are not fundamental, but in fact a number of Parameter name updates, and numerous textual updates and improvements.",
        "introduction_head": "Starting Points",
        "introduction": "<ul><li>The topic here is the Maturity of Security Incident Management (SIM) rather than just 'CSIRT' which by virtue of the name is about 'response' primarily. SIM has four major pillars:<ul><li>Prevention</li><li>Detection</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Quality control &amp; feedback</li></ul></li><li>The primary scope here is cyber security incidents: incidents that are directly related to computers of all sorts, network appliances including IoT devices, networks and the information therein and conveyed thereon. One can however extend this scope, or narrow it down, often with no significant consequences for the model.</li><li>For reasons of word economy, the term 'CSIRT' is used here to describe any SIM capability to which SIM3 is applied, whether team, service or function. 'ISIMC' Information Security Incident Management Capability is academically seen a better word than 'CSIRT' but the latter is widely known and therefore already rings all the right bells. The term 'CSIRT' is identical to the older name 'CERT', which is also commonly used.</li><li>The copyright holders promote widespread use of this model. The copyright statement is intended to keep the model unified, i.e. avoid various versions being used at the same time, but also to avoid the creation of look-alike models that will only muddy the waters for the CSIRT community other than that, the copyright holders promote an 'open source' not-for-profit approach which will help improve this model and its applications. Anyone wishing to expand or improve or add to SIM3 are kindly requested to get in touch with the Open CSIRT Foundation (OF). Note that for-profit use is intended and promoted as well, but those wishing to do so are also requested to get in touch with the Open CSIRT Foundation (OCF) to create a synergetic approach. Both maturity and certification gain in meaning when there is an agreed on starting point. TF-CSIRT and their Trusted Introducer (TI) trust model have already adopted the original SIM3 in May 2010. This means that at that time over 200 European CSIRTs supported the use of SIM3. TF-CSIRT/TI has additionally based their Certification scheme on SIM3, which was launched in September 2010.</li><li>Since that time, global fora such as FIRST, GFCE and ITU and trans-national fora like AfricaCERT, ENISA (and the EU CSIRTs Network), LACNIC, OAS and Trust Broker Africa have benefited from adopting SIM3, and several of them (especially ENISA) have contributed to its further development. Last but not least, a growing number of countries are adopting SIM3 for CSIRT development a few examples to show the geographical reach are Brazil, Japan, Slovakia and Vietnam.</li></ul>",
        "quadrants_head": "Basic Elements",
        "quadrants": "The SIM3 is built on three basic elements:<ol><li>Maturity Parameters</li><li>Maturity Quadrants</li><li>Maturity Levels</li></ol>The <em>Maturity Parameters</em> are the quantities that are measured in regard to maturity over 40 exist and they are detailed below.</br>Each Parameter belongs to one of four Quadrants - the Quadrants are therefore the main four categories of Parameters:<ul><li>O - Organisation</li><li>H - Human</li><li>T - Tools</li><li>P - Processes</li></ul> These four Quadrants have been chosen in such a way that the Parameters in there are as mutually independent as possible.",
        "scoring_head": "Measuring the Maturity",
        "scoring": "What we really measure are the Levels for each Parameter. A desirable simplicity of the SIM3 has been achieved by specifying a unique set of Levels, valid for all of the Parameters in all of the Quadrants:<ul><li>0 = not available / undefined / unaware</li><li>1 = implicit (known/considered but not written down, 'between the ears')</li><li>2 = explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way)</li><li>3 = explicit, formalised on authority of the CSIRT head or above (rubberstamped or published)</li><li>4 = explicit, audited on authority of governance levels above the CSIRT head (subject to control process/audit/enforcement)</li></ul>To make these five Levels even clearer, we offer a more informative description here: <ul><li>0 : This Level is mostly only met with teams who are fairly novice, as it means that the team members have not even been thinking yet about the Parameter in question. If during an assessment or audit all attendants produce blank looks when a Parameter is mentioned, this is probably a candidate for level 0. When a team starts actively discussing a Parameter, there is a high likelihood of it moving to Level 1 fairly soon.</li><li>1 : This Level is typically encountered with novice teams but, for some Parameters, also with experienced teams where a few experts know how to do things but never took the trouble of writing them down. When doing an assessment or audit and a Parameter at Level 1 is encountered, it is worthwhile asking a few team members to explain how they think about that Parameter. Chances are that the explanations will be different enough to convince the team as well as the team head that it is a good idea to actually write the content for that Parameter down, as to increase consistency within the team and also making it easier to get new team members up to speed.</li><li>2 : This Level is typically encountered when teams have internal information systems of a more informal type. Like a team-wiki, or shared site or similar. It is strongly recommended to have a facility like that for any CSIRT as it allows an easy way to bring the most important processes, tools (and manuals) and policies under the direct attention of those doing the incident management work. A wiki-style approach has the added advantage of allowing hyperlinks, thus enabling the internal information to be easily structured and interconnected: example, T-2 is the information sources list, and from that list you could easily point at the process(es) relevant for those various sources and those processes comprise the P-12 Parameter. <br> There are also some other cases that can lead to a Level 2 score, like for instance when some tool used by the team holds information relevant for one of the Parameters, but this information has not been ratified by the team head. Example: the incident tracking system (T-4) of the team will most likely have some kind of incident classification scheme (O-8) on board but that will be in the form of a dro-pdown choice: when that drop-down list has not been formally approved by the team head, the O-8 Parameter scores at level 2.<br>Going back to the wiki-style approach: the typical character of that approach is that various team members can write texts and fit them in and even when consensus among team members about such texts will come into existence after continued use (and adaptation, again wiki-style), this is still level 2, as there is no formal approval by the team head (or above). Level 2 is certainly valid to begin documentation with, but for most information it is advisable that, at some stage, what has come to be the consensus is also recognised as such and supported by the team head leading to level 3. </li><li>3 : This Level applies for any Parameter where the subject matter of that Parameter has been formally and explicitly (in “writing”) approved by the team head (or above). To mention a few of the most common situations for Level 3:<ul><li> The subject matter is part of policy or process documents on the team level, authorised by the team head: these comprise the most simple and direct case, however the risk inherent in separate documents is that if there are too many of those the overview is lost and it can become a separate paper reality, rather than part of the day-to-day procedures of the team. Therefore, it is important to integrate such documents in team operations and information systems to ensure that team members actually know and use them. For instance by integrating them into a team-wiki or similar. In addition, it is strongly recommended to use an expiry and maintenance system for team-internal documents. </li><li> Relevant policy (or process) documents authorised on a governance level higher than the team head: these are automatically also valid for the team head and the team; however it is essential that they are embedded into the team operations and information systems as to ensure that the team members actually know and use them.</li><li>Wiki-style level 2 information/pages/documents that are “upgraded” to become level 3: this of course requires explicit (visible) authorisation by the team head of such “pages”. It is currently not YET demanded by SIM3 but it is STRONGLY recommend to go one step beyond this and not just do authorisation, but also include some system of expiry and maintenance for such pages. Some wiki-types have facilities or plugins to make that easier.</li></ul></li><li>4 : This Level implies Level 3 plus an important addition that ensures that the Parameter in question is no longer just an internal matter of the team, but has the active attention of some higher governance level, above the team head. There needs to be evidence of this, and the evidence must include the following: <ol><li>There must be a process of checking, assessing or auditing of this Parameter on the authority of a higher governance level.</li><li>This process must be followed regularly. There is currently NOT YET a set rule for this in SIM3, but as best practice “regular” means at least once every 2 years, and usually once per year.</li><li> The process must be “active”, which means that there is a feedback mechanism towards the team head (and team) in addition to the process of checking and reporting on that. This feedback mechanism is meant to ensure that there is communication about the Parameter between team (head) and higher governance levels.</li></ol>This level 4 mechanism is meant to ensure that (a) the higher level of governance is actively aware of some of the crucial aspects of the CSIRT and how it functions in real life, and (b) as a consequence, to enable constructive communication between higher governance level and the team in order to enable improvements: clearer policies, better tools and processes, more people, better trainings and education, etcetera. <br>The evidence for level 4 is not always clear-cut. The clearest cases are the following two:<ul><li>When the topic of Parameter is formally and unambiguously part of a country's cyber (security) legislation that Parameter automatically scores level 4, because it is assumed that the system of legislation and the checks and balances associated with that are more than sufficient to warrant a level 4.  It is however important to note here that the mere mentioning of something in the law even if clear and unambiguous still requires the team to implement this internally as to be able to effectively “make the law work”. So this still requires documentation inside the team for such aspects, embedding in a team information system (e.g. team wiki), integration in internal training, etcetera.</li><li>When there is a team organisational framework or charter (Parameter O-10) or a “team handbook” it is strongly advised to have a paragraph there about the assessments/audits for the team, which is essentially the P-8 Parameter process. This should include internal team assessments (which on their own are not sufficient for level 4) but it should also address the process of auditing the team by a higher governance level or by an auditing department. As such higher level audits usually set their own rules, it is recommended to acknowledge their independent position, but to request a minimum set of aspects (which could directly be translated into SIM3 Parameters) on which the team wants to be audited. Most of the O-Parameters could be included there, plus optionally some others, like H-2, P-1 and P-2.</li></ul>In other cases, it is often harder to find clear evidence for the Level 4 character. For instance, when an auditing department does an extensive audit of the CSIRT every year, and they do use SIM3 as one of the controlling documents but no one has written down some minimum requirements for that audit. In such a case, alternative evidence can be a posteriori rather than a priori: meaning, simply ask for a few of those audit reports and see what is in there in order to be able to gauge whether it is reasonable to assume that certain SIM3 Parameters are indeed audited in the Level 4 way (including feedback to the team) and therefore there is reasonable substantiation to grant Level 4.</li></ul> </br>Such simplicity as is obtained by only 5 Levels for over 40 Parameters, is great in terms of ease of use and presentation but has its drawbacks too. This is especially noticeable in a few Parameters that, when you apply them in real life, are reluctant to be mapped onto a specific Level. However the advantages of this simplified scheme have shown since 2008 to far outweigh the few quirks encountered."

The authority is basically the powers that have been invested in your CSIRT. Some teams, like especially coordinating teams with an external constituency, have little powers, little authority and can perhaps only give advice to the constituency. Whereas others CSIRTs have the authority to enforce measures. What and how you can escalate, is also part of this. The whole purpose of this Parameter is to help ensure that the CSIRT has a clear and distinct description of their authority, which can serve as support in the back especially in crisis cases. It is important to realise that the authority of any CSIRT needs to come from higher governance, or else there will be no high-level support for the team in cases where the “power” needs to be used. For the example of a national CSIRT, if the national cyber security law provides clarity on their authority, so much the better U+2013 however, if the law is not very specific, then the CSIRT should make sure that the authority is defined more precisely, starting from the law.

Basically, the responsibility is a high-level version of what is detailed below in the team’s services (O-5). In almost all cases a team has more responsibility than authority. An example: a team may well be responsible for checking out if new threats could hurt their constituency, e.g. by doing non-interruptive port scans. But that’s not to say that the team has the authority to go beyond “non-interruptive” scans - or indeed that if the team finds such vulnerabilities, that it can 'order' the constituents in question what to do: this will often be in the form of advice, not enforcement. A situation to avoid is where a team’s authority is very small - but their responsibility very big. If the gap between O-3 and O-4 becomes too big, then a team is more or less expected to do many things, without having the power to actually make them work. That is a recipe for malfunctioning. There is a natural gap between O-3 and O-4 but it should not become too big. What responsibility does your team have?",

The original most popular listing of possible services to select from was the one from CERT/CC's CSIRT Handbook (also adopted by ENISA and Trusted Introducer). Since 2017, the FIRST CSIRT Services Framework has become a de-facto standard, because it offers a well structured and granular approach, especially in its latest 2.1 version. Whichever source you use, it is important to make a clear selection of those services you must or should offer based on your mandate, authority and responsibility - and taking into account the resources you have available.<br>It is essential to note here that the concept of O-5 is only to ask “have you defined your services towards the constituency, and what's the result”. Detailing what those services should or should not include is up to the team, SIM3 makes no specific demands (although of course in other parameters it is assumed that every CSIRT at least deals with Incident Management as a service). The best way of using SIM3 and the FIRST CSIRT Services Framework as complementary standards is by looking at it like this: SIM3 serves as the overall maturity standard for the CSIRT, and can be visualised by a horizontal line with over 40 Parameters as tickmarks on that line. On O-5 a vertical line intersects the SIM3 horizontal line: that vertical line is the visualisation of the FIRST CSIRT Services Framework, which every team is strongly recommended to use to map their services portfolio in detail.<br>All of this then leads to a list of services, and it is important to consider that at least your constituency needs to have access to this list, including your team's contact information and service windows. It is strongly advised to use RFC2350 as a standardised way to publish a high-level list of their services, contact info and service windows even to the Internet at large, as for any CSIRT it is important that it is known how to reach them, as they take responsibility for (part of) the security of their constituency, which is part of the wider Internet - when adopting RFC2350 make sure to have an English version publicly available (next to one in your native language).

Such more advanced ways of classifying incidents, coupled to the service levels defined in O-7, can help to deal in a structured way with higher incident loads. There are many ways of doing this, but it's advised to first see if the internal organisation already has some kind of severity/priority scheme for IT operations, and then possible adopt that.

This charter should include at least the SIM3 Parameters O-1 to O-9 and potentially a few more. Ideally, this charter has been approved by the same governance level that mandated your CSIRT. The great use of having such a consolidated write-up of O-10 is that this is indeed the high-level “charter” of any team the controlling document describing all the foundational issues for which the approval of higher governance is needed, and can serve as a reference from then on for the functioning of the team, for audits, etcetera.<br>O-10 is not necessarily only ONE document, though it is generally beneficial to have the foundational O-Parameters described in one document. Your team's charter is normally an internal document - therefore RFC2350, which is basically meant as public service description of your team, is not suitable as team charter - also RFC2350 is much more limited in scope than the charter is. If O-10 consists of more than one document, RFC2350 can be part of O-10 (but not all of it). For the example of national CSIRTs, most of O-10 can be in the national cyber security law - yet even then it can be very useful to re-iterate the O-10 related aspects in a charter on the team wiki, with the proper references. <br>There is one more variation that is worth mentioning: some CSIRTS decide to expand the charter document to comprise most or all SIM3 Parameters, thus creating what is often called a CSIRT handbook. The advantage of that approach is that all Parameters are described in one consolidated document - the flip side is that to get approval for such a handbook from the highest governance levels, means you also need to get high-level approval for all the more team-internal items like tools and processes, which may make version management more of a challenge.

So when we say 'security policy' this includes such important aspects as 'availability', and how to get back to normal after disruptions - but the landscape is even broader than that, thought also needs to be given to site security and resilience, and workspace security and resilience. Two important notes must be made here: <ul><li>There are some other BCM related aspects that surface in other SIM3 Parameters. Specifically in H-2 which is about staff resilience, and T-5 to T-7 which are about the resilience of basic CSIRT tools.</li><li>As a CSIRT, you often have IT/security/BCM requirements that differ from the normal ones - like you may want to be able to run tests without a firewall blocking those tests, or to receive e-mail without spam/malware filtering, you may want to place a honeypot somewhere, or you may need to be able to use encryption software like GPG or perhaps you need to have a dedicated Internet connections for back-up reasons, testing, etcetera. Such special CSIRT requirements often make it necessary that additional to your host's organisation security policy, your CSIRT also has its own security policy (again including the aspect of BCM).

Often called a 'Code of Conduct (CoC)' a 'Code of Practice (CoP)' or 'Ethics guideline', it can provide golden rules on confidentiality, trustworthiness, and other key human qualities expected from CSIRT team members. Note that in most cases the CSIRT's host organisation will have some kind of ethics code, but such codes are of a generic nature and have nothing to do with the specific work that the CSIRT does - therefore such generic codes are not valid to satisfy H-1. The CSIRT regularly deals with highly sensitive data, and communicates not just inside the host organisation, but also outside. Also, responsible behaviour of CSIRT team members is not limited to the work context, but also relevant in private circles where security is concerned. The Trusted Introducer CSIRT Code of Practice (TI CCoP) can be used as CoP baseline, as it was written specifically for CSIRTs; another excellent starting point is 'EthicsFIRST' made by FIRST, which has its own website. That said, specific CSIRT cooperations, or even specific teams, can have good reasons to make their own code. Do note that proper alignment with the security policy (O-11) is always necessary. Does your team support such a code of conduct/practice/ethics?",

Such a list should include information about hardware, software and OT that the constituency members use. This should include relevant configurations: such more detailed information (including software versions in use) is necessary to deal with threats more effectively. Some organisations use IT assets management (ITAM) for this purpose, and maintain a configuration management database (CMDB). The CSIRT usually does not manage such assets/configuration lists, but does need to have access to them. Maintaining up-to-date and detailed information about the whole IT hardware/software and configuration landscape is challenging, and sometimes even impossible as in the case of coordinating CSIRTs with constituencies who 'run anything you can think of'. The fallback solution is to focus on only the most critical assets - and in such a case it could be the CSIRT itself who collects and maintains that information, in direct communication with their constituency. For national CSIRTs this task is even harder - and there especially a focus on CI(I) assets is necessary. Does your CSIRT have access to IT assets and configurations?",

In practice, when a team has to handle many incidents, it is near impossible to correctly manage all information and communication between team and involved parties, without such a tracking system. Only really small teams with a small number of incidents are able to manage the incident management process by using a very basic solution like a shared spreadsheet. In most cases, a dedicated solution is in need. Sometimes, the team reverts to using the host organisation's trouble ticket system - this is certainly possible, but similar to the e-mail case, confidentiality may again be a challenge, as most generic trouble ticket systems don't seem to have been designed with security in mind. Many CSIRTS have long term been using their own specific incident tracking systems - specifically open source solutions like RT(IR) (Request Tracker for Incident Response), OTRS (Open Source Ticketing Request System) or (of more recent date) TheHive.

Therefore the uptime of the Internet access needs to at least support and preferably exceed the team's service levels (Parameter O-7). Thus if a team has to be able to react quickly to incidents and solve them expediently, then the uptime of the Internet access needs to be very high, so that any failure there does not hinder the team's performance. Ideally, the CSIRT or its host organisation has a fully (even physically) redundant Internet access, but much less expensive solutions like having a back-up Internet access option (using a different technology as the normal one) may also be sufficient to meet your team's service level demands. As most teams depend on their host organisation for Internet access, it's useful that the team is qualified internally as one of the most demanding organisation units in regard Internet access.

All processes can be characterised by a number of attributes. By applying such attributes we can also determine how successful a particular process is (in getting the job done) or how successful a particular organisation is in providing a service (as in getting this process right all the time). In mature organisations processes are documented, measurable and repeatable. To be able to grow and improve the effectiveness of an organisation it is also important to build processes that are adaptable. Here, we specifically talk about those processes that support the management of incidents and any other services the CSIRT offers - and we adopt the term 'processes' in the broadest meaning of the word, so that in this Processes area you will also find processes that might sometimes be labeled 'policy' or otherwise.",

Such escalations triggered by security incidents or other events should be defined in accordance with the team's Incident Classification (see O-8), which allows logically basing the escalation on e.g. impact and priority. It is critical that the means to escalate must be available at all times - even though the feedback or reaction will not always be as immediate, as this is defined by higher governance levels in the own organisation, or in constituents' organisations.

How to do that is described in the detection process(es).Triage, the process of judging incoming incident reports and assigning them for further handling, is part of incident detection.  Usually, tools are used to support these processes (see T-8), and then how to do that will be part of the process.

But such a generic process ensures the overall workflow and can not be tailored for specific types of incidents, and thus will more than likely miss out on some relevant technical aspects. As already stated for P-6, an incident caused by a new malware APT is very different from a DDoS attack blocking the Internet for an important client. Not only are the priorities different, but also the technical response. Therefore it is recommend for mature CSIRTs to identify those incident types that are causing most of the work - and then to write specific incident processes for those. This will allow to leave out some steps or activities, while describing others in more detail or adding new ones (could be sub-steps of the generic process). Additionally, specific incident processes can be written not just for very common incident types, but also for mission critical incidents (high impact, high priority), or for incidents that require a response requiring expertise not commonly present inside the CSIRT itself, like legal expertise. Note that P-7 may be already part of P-6, if the incident resolution process supports sub-processes to deal with some specific incident types or supports various paths for some specific incident types - this is of course perfectly valid.

Also it needs to be ensured that there is not just 'audit' but also a subsequent feedback to the team, to enable learning and improvement. We call this the audit & feedback process. This process needs to ensure that the appropriate quality levels are met, and that problems are recognised as soon as possible. The resulting information flow needs to benefit not only the team itself, but also the relevant management layers above the CSIRT. This is especially important for those topics covered by SIM3 Parameters where the team aims to score level 4 - for those, a regular, active form of checking by the higher management (above the CSIRT manager) is required - and it must be documented that they are audited that way and that feedback is given to the team. This involvement of the higher management is a crucial mechanism, as some quality aspects cannot be ensured by the CSIRT itself, not even if controlled by the CSIRT manager or team lead. Unbiased, neutral feedback is mandatory as not to focus on mistakes or errors, but instead to focus on improvement and progress, with the mission of the organisation/constituency in mind.
